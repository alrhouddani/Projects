disk and file systems
A disk drive track is a circular path on the surface of a disk 
Disk sector is a subdivision of a track on a magnetic disk or optical disc.
cluster known in windows as allocation unit size
more clusters means slow performance
less clusters means faster performance

Disk Partitions: MBR vs GPT
--------------------------------------------------------------------
	    :	MBR 		     :	 GPT
partitype   : Stored in a boot sector:	stored with every partition
parlimit    : 4 primary partition    : 128 primary partition
volume size : up to 2TB		     : up to 18EB   
Boot os	yes :Yes                     : with UEFI
When to use : older systems	     : Whenever is possible

## configure storge pools
physical layer works with local or direct disks

Simple: like Raid0 no extra copies or Data resiliency good for high performance work load and data lost is 
acceptable
mirror: like raid1 needs provids resiliency withstand 2disk failers
parity: like Raid5 good for backup or streaming media 
Storage tiers u can mix the type of disk ssd with hhd 

support for write-back cache it will act as a buffer

##Advance storage feature 
ISCSI Internet Small Computer Systems Interface 
ISNS Internet Storage Name Service is a protocol that enables automated discovery and management of iSCSI devices on a TCP/IP storage network
DCB: Data Center Bridging DCB is a suite of Institute of Electrical 
	and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) standards that enable Converged Fabrics in the data center,
	where storage, data networking, cluster IPC and management traffic all share the same Ethernet network
FC: Fibre Channel is a layer 2 switching technology or cut through, with the protocol handled entirely in hardware.
 	The iSCSI protocol (SCSI mapped to TCP/IP) running on Ethernet is a layer 3 switching 
	technology with the protocol handled in software, hardware

DR: Disaster recovery is an organizationâ€™s method of regaining access and functionality to its IT infrastructure 
	after events like a natural disaster, cyber attack, or even business disruptions
RPO:Recovery Point Objective, is a measure of the maximum tolerable amount of data that the business can afford to lose during a disaster
RTO: Recovery Time Objective (RTO) is the duration of time and a service level within which a business process must be restored 
##Data deduplication is a process that eliminates excessive copies of data and significantly decreases storage
Data DDulication has to be installed
